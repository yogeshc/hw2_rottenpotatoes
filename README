RottenPotatoes Enhancement #1: Sorting the list of all movies

You will enhance RottenPotatoes in the following ways:

On the "All Movies" page, the column headings for "Movie Title" and "Release Date" for a movie should be clickable links. 
Clicking one of them should cause the list to be reloaded but sorted in ascending order on that column. 
Namely,clicking the "Movie Title" column should list the movies alphabetically by title 
(for movies whose names begin with non-letters, the sort order should match the behavior of String#<=>), and
clicking the "Release Date" column heading should redisplay the list of movies with the earliest-released movies first.
When the listing page is redisplayed with sorting-on-a-column enabled, 
the column header that was selected for sorting should appear with a yellow background, as shown below. 
You should do this by setting controller variables that are used to conditionally set the CSS class of the 
appropriate table heading to hilite, and pasting this simple CSS snippet into 
RottenPotatoes's app/assets/stylesheets/application.css file.
